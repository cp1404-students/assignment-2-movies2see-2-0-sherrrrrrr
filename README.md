# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies2See 2.0 by JiaxinLi

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of movies.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

### Estimate: 

10 days

### Actual: 

5 days

## 2. What are you most satisfied with? 

It took a lot of time, but in the end my code ran successfully.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

kivy. I watched a lot of youtube video to understand that.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

The utilization of classes and modular coding worked exceptionally well in the development process. 
By encapsulating movie data and operations within a Movie class and managing the collection with a
MovieCollection class, I was able to keep the code organized and maintainable. 

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

I would like to improve my testing strategy to include more comprehensive automated tests, 
which would ensure that each component behaves correctly before they are integrated next time.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

In addition to what's in the class, I watched some youtube video and our lecture powerpoints on kivy  to better understand 
the structure and style formation.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

Initially the updates I made to the GUI did not reflect the changes made on the backend.
To fix this, I went back through the course material and used some youtube video explanations to 
learn, refactored the application to use ListProperty and ObjectProperty to bind data, solved
the synchronization problem.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

Classes allowed me to encapsulate related data and functions, making the codebase easier to 
manage and extend. For instance, by creating a Movie class, I could easily add methods to 
manipulate movie data, which could then be universally applied across all instances of the class.
This not only streamlined the development process but also made the code much cleaner and more 
robust against bugs.
